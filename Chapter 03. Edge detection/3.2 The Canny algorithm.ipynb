    "The Canny edge detector<sup>[[1]](#cite1)</sup> is an algorithm that combines a number of techniques: \n",
    "- the DroG operator, \n",
    "- non-maxima suppression, and \n",
    "- hysteresis. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was designed to be a good detector, yield a good localization, and to provide a single response!\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Noise filtering and gradient image**. Apply the DroG operator to reduce noise and obtain a gradient image.$\\\\[5pt]$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Non-maximum suppression**. This removes pixels that are not considered to be part of an edge. Typically, the gradient image obtained after using DroG presents thick edges. The idea is to keep only those pixels that are maximum within their neighborhood in the direction of the gradient, suppressing the rest of them. Hence, only thin lines (candidate edges) will remain. For that:\n",
    "\n",
    "     - We consider 4 main directions or *angular sectors*: $[0,45]$, $[45,90]$, $[90,135]$, $[135,180]$. The gradient angle $\\theta[i,j]$ is approximated by where it lays. \n",
    "     - A 3x3 filter is moved over the gradient image $G[i,j]$ at each pixel, and it suppresses the edge strength of the center pixel (for example by setting its value to 0) if its magnitude is not greater than the magnitude of the two neighbors in the gradient direction. This way we have a single response at each edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/canny_nonmaxima.png\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hysteresis**: The final step, for which the Canny algorithm uses two thresholds (upper and lower) to determine edge pixels:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If the grey level of a candidate pixel of the gradient image is higher than the upper threshold, the pixel is accepted as an edge.\n",
    "    - If the grey level of a candidate pixel of the gradient image is below the lower threshold, then it is rejected.\n",
    "    - If the grey level of a candidate pixel of the gradient image is between the two thresholds, then it will be accepted only if it is connected to a pixel that is above the upper threshold and rejected otherwise.\n",
    "   \n",
    "<img src=\"./images/hysteresis.png\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm can be executed repeatedly with different levels of smoothing (changing the sigma of the DroG operator). Different sigmas produce edges at different spatial features."
